zone 8 8 0 30 A small book, sitting on the table. Yeah I know, I said the table was empty, but looks like I lied. Oh well.

txt 1 0 If you would like to make changes, you can fork this repo. You can also make a forked map of it so you can use the builder. Then, after that, you type /rawmap, do those changes, and then make that be the file. If you need any help, feel free to ask other players. Thanks, and have fun with my idea!
